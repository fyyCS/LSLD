# Environment

You should install [CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP) and [LAION-CLAP](https://github.com/LAION-AI/CLAP)

# Datasets

Resnet and VGGish features can be downloaded from [Unified Multisensory Perception: Weakly-Supervised Audio-Visual Video Parsing](https://github.com/YapengTian/AVVP-ECCV20)

We also provide [visual feature]() extracted by CLIP and [audio feature]() extracted by LAION-CLAP
